# Core tools reference

> This is the reference for the core reMarkable tools (read, browse, search,
> render, export, upload, manage, SSH authoring). They come from the original
> [remarkable-mcp](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp) by Sam Morrow,
> which Marginalia builds on. The workflow layer is documented in
> [workflows.md](workflows.md); the project overview is the [README](../README.md).


Access a reMarkable library from MCP clients such as Claude, VS Code Copilot,
OpenWebUI, and other compatible tools.


> **This fork adds a workflow layer** ([docs/workflows.md](workflows.md)) that
> interprets pen strokes instead of only exposing them, so even small agents can
> use the tablet as a front end:
> pen review of Markdown drafts with change requests mapped to source lines ·
> forms and yes/no questions read from ticks · an Agent Inbox for handwritten
> requests · sketch → diagram (Mermaid/SVG) · a reading queue that returns
> highlights as deep-linked quotes · `remarkable_whats_new` to check it all in one
> call. Handwriting is transcribed via MyScript (stroke-based), Google Vision or
> Claude. Install with `uvx --from "remarkable-mcp[web] @ git+https://github.com/comino/remarkable-mcp@main" remarkable-mcp`.

## Quick Install

### Prerequisite: install `uv`

The commands below use `uvx`, which is included with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Page images are rasterized with PyMuPDF; no system Cairo, browser, or graphics
runtime needs to be installed on macOS, Linux, or Windows.

#### macOS and Linux

Use the [official standalone installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

#### Windows

Use the [official standalone installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) from PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or install with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```

### Choose a connection

Start with the first mode that fits your setup.

| Order | Mode | Setup | Writes | Use when |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | USB web | Connect the tablet and enable USB web | Upload; destination chosen by tablet | You want the shortest setup without a subscription or developer mode |
| 2 | Local directory | Install and sign in to the desktop app | No | You want offline, device-free reads from the desktop cache |
| 3 | Cloud | Register once; Connect subscription required | Full document and folder management | You need wireless or remote access |
| 4 | SSH | Enable developer mode and configure SSH | Full management and native authoring | You need direct filesystem access or native ink writes |

### USB Web Interface

Connect via USB and enable the web interface in your tablet's Storage Settings.

1. Connect your reMarkable via USB
2. On your tablet, open **Settings > Storage** and enable **USB web interface**
3. Install via the button above

<details>
<summary>Manual USB web configuration</summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--usb"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Make sure your reMarkable is connected via USB and unlocked
- Verify USB web interface is enabled in Settings > Storage
- The tablet should be accessible at `http://10.11.99.1`

</details>

---

### Local Directory Mode

Read the official reMarkable desktop app's sync folder from disk. This mode is
offline and read-only. The desktop app controls synchronization.

<details>
<summary>Local directory configuration</summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--local-dir"]
    }
  }
}
```

With no path, the desktop app's data folder is auto-detected:

- **macOS (current app):** `~/Library/Containers/com.remarkable.desktop/Data/Library/Application Support/remarkable/desktop`
- **macOS (legacy app):** `~/Library/Application Support/remarkable/desktop`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\remarkable\desktop`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/remarkable/desktop`

Or point at any xochitl-style directory (e.g. a tablet backup):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--local-dir", "/path/to/xochitl-data"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Content freshness depends on the desktop app. Keep it running and signed in.
- This mode is read-only. Direct writes could bypass synchronization and corrupt the app cache.
- If the directory can't be found and a cloud token is configured, the server falls back to cloud mode for read access (the server remains read-only because it was launched in local-directory mode)

</details>

---

### Cloud Mode

Cloud mode works without a device connection and requires a reMarkable Connect subscription.

It fetches metadata in parallel and caches content-addressed blobs on disk. See
[Cloud performance and caching](#cloud-performance--caching) for configuration.

<details>
<summary>Cloud mode setup</summary>

#### 1. Get a One-Time Code

Go to [my.remarkable.com/device/desktop/connect](https://my.remarkable.com/device/desktop/connect) and generate a code.

#### 2. Convert to Token

```bash
uvx remarkable-mcp --register YOUR_CODE
```

Registration saves the token to `~/.rmapi`. When your MCP client runs the server as the same user on the same machine, remarkable-mcp reads that file automatically, so you do not need to put a token in the client configuration. Set `REMARKABLE_TOKEN` only when `~/.rmapi` is unavailable, such as when the server runs under another user or on another machine.

#### 3. Configure your MCP client

##### Minimal client-neutral server definition

Add this server definition using the MCP configuration UI or wrapper required by your client:

```json
{
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["remarkable-mcp"]
}
```

No `env` entry is needed when the server can read the token from `~/.rmapi`.

##### VS Code

VS Code's `.vscode/mcp.json` uses a top-level `servers` object. The saved
`~/.rmapi` credential means no token input is required:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Claude Desktop and other clients

Claude Desktop and many other MCP clients use a top-level `mcpServers` object and literal values in `env`; they do not use VS Code's `inputs` array. With the token available in `~/.rmapi`, the minimal configuration is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If the token file is unavailable, add `"env": {"REMARKABLE_TOKEN": "your-token"}` to the `remarkable` server entry. Consult your client's documentation if it uses a different outer key or secret-storage mechanism.

</details>

---

### SSH Mode

SSH provides direct filesystem access and native notebook authoring. It requires
[developer mode](ssh-setup.md), which factory-resets the tablet when enabled.
Use this mode only when USB web, local directory, or cloud mode does not provide the
operation you need.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--ssh"]
    }
  }
}
```

See the [SSH setup guide](ssh-setup.md) for authentication and device setup.

## Connection Modes

All modes support reading, rendering, and single-document export. Cloud and SSH support full library
management. USB web supports upload but does not accept a destination folder.
Local directory mode is
read-only.

| Mode | Setup | Subscription | Offline | Tablet required | Raw source | Upload | Folder operations¹ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local directory | Desktop app installed | No² | Yes | No | PDF and EPUB | No | No |
| USB web | Enable in Settings | No | Yes | Yes | PDF | Root only | No |
| Cloud | One-time registration | Connect | No | No | PDF and EPUB | Yes | Yes |
| SSH | Developer mode | No | Yes | Yes | PDF and EPUB | Yes | Yes |

¹ Folder ops = create folder / move / rename / delete. Upload and folder ops are enabled by default; pass `--read-only` to expose a read-only server. Deletes move items to the trash and prompt for confirmation when your client supports elicitation, and are refused without it unless `REMARKABLE_SKIP_CONFIRM=1` is set.

² The desktop app itself signs in to the reMarkable cloud to sync; local directory mode just reads whatever the app has already synced to disk.

### Automatic cloud fallback

If a selected device transport is unavailable and a cloud credential is configured,
the server falls back to cloud mode. A server launched with `--local-dir` remains
read-only after fallback. `remarkable_status` reports the effective transport and
sets `fell_back_to_cloud`.

Pass `--no-cloud-fallback` (or set `REMARKABLE_DISABLE_CLOUD_FALLBACK=1`) to disable this and fail instead when the device is unreachable.

The transport is resolved once per server process. Restart the MCP server after
connecting a device or starting the desktop app if the process already fell back to
cloud.

- [SSH setup](ssh-setup.md)

## OpenWebUI (Streamable HTTP)

OpenWebUI's native MCP connection uses Streamable HTTP. Start remarkable-mcp on
the same machine:

```bash
uvx remarkable-mcp --http
```

Then add `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` as the MCP server URL in OpenWebUI. The
HTTP transport combines with `--usb`, `--ssh`, and `--read-only`; for example:

```bash
uvx remarkable-mcp --usb --http
```

The bind address and port can also be set with `--host` / `--port` or
`REMARKABLE_MCP_HOST` / `REMARKABLE_MCP_PORT`.

The server uses MCP Python SDK 2.x's dual-era endpoint. Modern
`2026-07-28` requests are sessionless; older clients continue to use the
initialize handshake and legacy MCP sessions on the same `/mcp` route. The
reMarkable token and selected tablet transport remain process-local CLI/env
configuration and are never inferred from MCP HTTP authorization headers.

> [!WARNING]
> Streamable HTTP has no built-in authentication. It binds to `127.0.0.1` by
> default. Keep that default unless you control the network boundary. Wildcard
> binds such as `0.0.0.0` and `::` are rejected because they cannot provide a
> strict Host allowlist. A concrete non-loopback address is allowed but exposes
> every enabled tool, including writes, to clients that can reach the port.

### Remote access through an authenticated reverse proxy

Keep remarkable-mcp on its default loopback bind and put the proxy on the same
host. MCPServer's DNS-rebinding protection only permits loopback `Host` and
`Origin` values by default. A proxy that forwards its public hostname unchanged
will therefore receive **421 Misdirected Request**; a public browser `Origin`
will receive **403 Forbidden**.

The proxy must authenticate requests, rewrite `Host` to the loopback upstream,
and clear `Origin`. For example, with nginx and an existing htpasswd file:

```nginx
location /mcp {
    auth_basic "reMarkable MCP";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/remarkable-mcp.htpasswd;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;

    # Required by MCPServer's default DNS-rebinding protection.
    proxy_set_header Host 127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_set_header Origin "";
}
```

Do not expose the upstream port directly. Configure OpenWebUI with the
authenticated proxy URL, such as `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`.

For NixOS, `remarkable-mcp-bridge.nix` provides a systemd module with the same
loopback default:

```nix
{
  imports = [ ./remarkable-mcp-bridge.nix ];
  services.remarkable-mcp = {
    enable = true;
    command = "/opt/remarkable-mcp/.venv/bin/remarkable-mcp";
  };
}
```

The service user must have its reMarkable credentials under
`/var/lib/remarkable-mcp` (or the configured `home`). The module adds
Tesseract to the service's executable search path; install the configured
`command` separately.

---

## OpenClaw Integration

remarkable-mcp works as an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill. Add to your `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--usb"]
    }
  }
}
```

Install from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai):

```bash
clawhub install remarkable-mcp
```

Or copy the `SKILL.md` from this repository into your `~/.openclaw/skills/remarkable-mcp/` directory.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remarkable_read` | Read and extract text from documents (with pagination and search) |
| `remarkable_browse` | Navigate folders, search by document name, or filter by tags |
| `remarkable_search` | Search content across multiple documents (with tag filtering) |
| `remarkable_recent` | Get recently modified documents |
| `remarkable_status` | Check connection status and the per-transport capability matrix |
| `remarkable_image` | Get PNG/SVG images of pages with optional OCR |
| `remarkable_export` | Export one document as a temporary PDF or Markdown resource |
| `remarkable_annotations` | Interpret pen marks (strike, underline, circle, notes…) on any document |
| `remarkable_review_send` | Send a Markdown draft as a pen-review PDF (numbered paragraphs, note margin) |
| `remarkable_review_collect` | Turn review marks into change requests pointing at source lines |
| `remarkable_review_list` | List review rounds and which have new marks waiting |
| `remarkable_ask` / `remarkable_form_*` | Questions and forms answered with ticks on the tablet |
| `remarkable_inbox*` | Handwritten requests in an "Agent Inbox" become agent tasks |
| `remarkable_sketch` / `remarkable_regions` | Hand-drawn diagrams → graph + Mermaid; page ink → regions |
| `remarkable_clip` / `remarkable_reading_*` | Web articles → tablet; highlights → quotes with deep links |
| `remarkable_whats_new` | One call: what needs attention across all workflows |

The read/search/render tools are read-only. `remarkable_export` never changes the
tablet, but it writes a bounded temporary file on the MCP server host and therefore
declares `readOnlyHint=false`. Export links expire after 15 minutes and the server
retains at most eight at a time.
Supported transports also register write tools by default; pass `--read-only` to
disable them. See [Write Tools](#write-tools-by-transport). Clients that support
[MCP Apps](#interactive-canvas-app-mcp-apps) can also open `remarkable_canvas`.

[Full tools reference](tools.md) · [Workflow tools: pen review, ink analysis](workflows.md)

### Tool behavior

- Browsing a document path returns its content.
- Empty notebook text can trigger OCR automatically.
- Search can scan several matching documents.
- Image tools return visual content that text extraction misses.
- `remarkable_read.total_pages` is the physical document count; `content_pages`
  counts extracted-text chunks, and `more` / `next_page` continue those chunks.
  Raw PDF reads count pages from the already-downloaded PDF. If a raw EPUB's
  separate archive cannot be read, its text still returns with
  `total_pages: null` and `total_pages_known: false`.
- PNG images of PDF-backed pages merge the source page and annotations
  automatically; pass `render_merged=False` for the annotation layer alone.
- PDF exports preserve physical page order and merge mapped source underlays with
  annotations by default. Markdown exports keep fixed source/typed/annotation/
  highlight/OCR sections without guessing document structure.
- OCR uses Google Vision when configured and otherwise runs locally with Tesseract.
- Browse and search accept tag filters.

### Example Usage

```python
# Read a document
remarkable_read("Meeting Notes")

# Search for keywords
remarkable_read("Project Plan", grep="deadline")

# Enable OCR for handwritten notes
remarkable_read("Journal", include_ocr=True)

# Browse your library
remarkable_browse("/Work/Projects")

# Filter by tags
remarkable_browse("/", tags=["important"])
remarkable_browse("/Work", tags=["project", "active"])

# Search across documents
remarkable_search("meeting", grep="action items")

# Search with tag filter
remarkable_search("project", tags=["work"])

# Get recent documents
remarkable_recent(limit=10)

# Get a page image (for visual content like UI mockups or diagrams)
remarkable_image("UI Mockup", page=1)

# Get SVG for editing in design tools
remarkable_image("Wireframe", output_format="svg")

# Get image with OCR text extraction
remarkable_image("Handwritten Notes", include_ocr=True)

# Imported PDF pages include their reMarkable annotations automatically
remarkable_image("Research Paper", page=3)

# Request only the reMarkable annotation layer
remarkable_image("Research Paper", page=3, render_merged=False)

# Transparent background for compositing
remarkable_image("Logo Sketch", background="#00000000")

# Compatibility mode: return resource URI instead of embedded resource
remarkable_image("Diagram", compatibility=True)

# Export a complete PDF through a temporary MCP ResourceLink
remarkable_export("Meeting Notes")

# Export honest, sectioned Markdown with opt-in OCR
remarkable_export("Journal", output_format="markdown", include_ocr=True)

# Export only full-page annotation layers when archive data is available
remarkable_export("Research Paper", pdf_mode="annotations")
```

> **Note:** PNG rendering uses PyMuPDF for both notebook SVGs and PDF pages, so
> `remarkable_image` does not require Cairo, Inkscape, Chromium, or another
> system graphics runtime. If local stroke parsing cannot handle a page, USB
> and SSH modes fall back to the tablet's native PDF export and cloud mode falls
> back to an original source PDF when one exists.

---

## Resources

Documents are automatically registered as MCP resources:

| URI Scheme | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `remarkable:///{path}.txt` | Extracted text content |
| `remarkableraw:///{path}.pdf.txt` | Extracted text from the original PDF |
| `remarkableraw:///{path}.epub.txt` | Extracted text from the original EPUB |
| `remarkableimg:///{path}.page-{N}.png` | PNG image of page N (notebooks only) |
| `remarkablesvg:///{path}.page-{N}.svg` | SVG vector image of page N (notebooks only) |
| `remarkableexport:///{format}/{id}` | Temporary generated PDF or Markdown export |

Trashed documents are excluded from tool, canvas, and resource lookup, so a
trashed item cannot shadow a live document with the same name.

`remarkable_export` returns a `ResourceLink` instead of embedding potentially
large file content in the tool response. The server stores the file in a private
temporary directory for 15 minutes, retains at most eight exports, and removes
managed exports at shutdown. Fetch and save the linked resource for durable use.

## OCR for Handwriting

For handwritten content, remarkable-mcp offers two OCR backends:

| Backend | Setup | Offline | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Vision | API key | No | Good handwriting support |
| Tesseract | System install | Yes | Better suited to printed text |

### Quick Setup

Set `REMARKABLE_OCR_BACKEND` in your MCP config:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "REMARKABLE_OCR_BACKEND": "auto"
  }
}
```

**Options:** `auto`, `google`, `tesseract`

<details>
<summary>Google Cloud Vision</summary>

1. Enable [Cloud Vision API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vision.googleapis.com)
2. Create an [API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
3. Add to config: `"GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY": "your-key"`

**Cost:** 1,000 free requests/month, then ~$1.50 per 1,000.

[Google Vision setup guide](google-vision-setup.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tesseract</summary>

Open-source OCR designed for printed text. Poor results with handwriting, but useful as an offline fallback.

```bash
# Install Tesseract
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

# Windows
choco install tesseract
```

</details>

### Default Behavior (`auto`)

When `REMARKABLE_OCR_BACKEND=auto` (default):
1. Google Vision (if `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY` is set)
2. Tesseract (fallback)

## Write Tools by Transport

Write tools let you upload, organize, and manage documents on your reMarkable. **Enabled by default on write-capable transports.** Cloud and SSH modes support the full set; USB web supports upload only (its firmware exposes no folder operations); local-directory mode is always read-only. Pass `--read-only` to expose a read-only server elsewhere.

| Feature | Local Directory | Cloud Mode | SSH Mode | USB Web Mode |
|---------|:---------------:|:----------:|:--------:|:------------:|
| Upload | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (tablet-selected folder) |
| Mkdir | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Move | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Rename | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete | ❌ | ✅ (→ trash) | ✅ (→ trash; optional permanent) | ❌ |

### Disabling Write Tools (read-only mode)

Write tools are on by default in each write-capable mode. Local-directory mode is always read-only. To make another transport read-only, add the `--read-only` flag:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--read-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

It combines with any transport flag (`--ssh`, `--usb`):
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--ssh", "--read-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or set the environment variable:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "REMARKABLE_READ_ONLY": "1"
  }
}
```

> The legacy `--write` flag and `REMARKABLE_ENABLE_WRITE` variable are still accepted for backward compatibility but are now no-ops (write is the default). `--write` and `--read-only` are mutually exclusive.

### Available Write Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remarkable_upload(file_path, parent_folder, document_name, defer_restart, orientation)` | Upload a PDF or EPUB file (cloud, SSH, and USB web; USB web preserves the name but ignores `parent_folder` and `orientation`). `orientation="landscape"` makes the tablet open wide pages in landscape |
| `remarkable_markdown_to_pdf(markdown, document_name, parent_folder, defer_restart)` | Render Markdown as a paginated PDF and upload it (cloud, SSH, and USB web) |
| `remarkable_mkdir(folder_name, parent, defer_restart)` | Create a new folder (cloud and SSH) |
| `remarkable_move(document, dest_folder, defer_restart)` | Move a document or folder (cloud and SSH) |
| `remarkable_rename(document, new_name, defer_restart)` | Rename a document or folder (cloud and SSH) |
| `remarkable_delete(document, defer_restart, permanent)` | Move a document/folder to Trash; SSH can permanently remove it with `permanent=True` |
| `remarkable_refresh()` | Safely restart `xochitl` once to apply pending writes made with `defer_restart=True`; no-op after this process has confirmed a clean state — **SSH only** |
| `remarkable_author(method, ..., defer_restart)` | Author native ink and notebooks — `draw` (append strokes), `add_page` (append a blank notebook page), `create_document` (new notebook) — **SSH only** |

### Safety

- **Upload registers in cloud, SSH, and USB web mode** — local-directory mode never exposes write tools.
- **mkdir, move, rename, delete register in cloud and SSH modes only** — they are not exposed on USB web (the tablet's USB web firmware has no folder/move/rename/delete endpoints), keeping the tool list scoped to what the active transport actually supports.
- **Delete prompts for confirmation when possible** — if the client supports MCP elicitation, `remarkable_delete` asks the user to confirm before deleting. MCP SDK 2.x carries that prompt as a multi-round input request for `2026-07-28` clients and as push elicitation for legacy clients. If the client can't show a prompt, the delete is **refused** (not performed) unless `REMARKABLE_SKIP_CONFIRM=1` is set — so write-on-by-default can't silently delete from clients that lack elicitation. Cloud and SSH move items to Trash by default. SSH also supports `permanent=True` for an explicitly requested permanent removal; cloud permanent deletion remains a Trash-management operation in the app/tablet. Set `REMARKABLE_SKIP_CONFIRM=1` to allow deletes without a prompt in automated setups. All write tools carry `ToolAnnotations(read_only_hint=False)` (and `destructive_hint=True` for delete) so an agent harness can gate writes at the MCP layer.
- **SSH work is fair and serialized per server** — one FIFO dispatcher owns every SSH subprocess, so startup scans, reads, uploads, mutations, and refresh probes cannot churn the tablet's USB CDC connection concurrently. Cached metadata reads bypass the queue.
- **Concurrent SSH writes share a refresh barrier** — near-simultaneous writes are persisted in FIFO order, then every participating call waits for one shared `xochitl` restart before reporting success. A bounded debounce coalesces bursts without background or late success.
- **SSH refreshes avoid the firmware emergency-reboot path** — the serialized refresh clears only `xochitl`'s systemd start counter immediately before restart, then requires stable, non-multiplexed SSH sessions on the same boot. OpenSSH aliases are resolved with `ssh -G`; if USB web was reachable at that effective host before restart, port 80 must recover too. A failed probe keeps `refresh_pending: true` and never replays the write.
- **Retries are deliberately narrow** — only connection failures that prove the remote command never started (for example connection refused, connect timeout, or banner timeout) receive bounded exponential backoff. Ambiguous/post-start write failures are never replayed; the error directs the caller to refresh and inspect the tablet instead.
- For explicit bulk operations, pass `defer_restart=True` to each write (including `remarkable_author`) — or set `REMARKABLE_DEFER_RESTART=1` — and call `remarkable_refresh()` once at the end. Deferred writes return immediately with `refresh_pending: true`; an extra refresh is a no-op only after the current server process has confirmed a clean state. A new process performs one conservative recovery refresh because it cannot know whether an earlier process left disk changes pending.
- A multi-step SSH write that fails after any confirmed mutation returns `write_partially_persisted`, says **do not repeat**, and reports whether refresh recovery is still pending. A shared refresh failure is propagated only to participants whose own mutation was dirty; clean validation/pre-execution failures retain their original error.
- USB HTTP requests use the same bounded operation core with `REMARKABLE_USB_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default `2`). Cloud sync keeps its existing pooled, idempotency-aware request layer and `REMARKABLE_SYNC_WORKERS` control.

### Examples

```python
# Upload a PDF
remarkable_upload("paper.pdf", parent_folder="/Research")

# Upload a wide PDF so the tablet opens it in landscape
remarkable_upload("slides.pdf", orientation="landscape")

# Render Markdown and upload the PDF without creating a local file
remarkable_markdown_to_pdf(
    "# Meeting Notes\n\n- Follow up with Sam",
    document_name="Meeting Notes",
    parent_folder="/Research",
)

# Create a folder
remarkable_mkdir("2024 Archive", parent="/Archive")

# Move a document
remarkable_move("Meeting Notes", "/Archive/2024 Archive")

# Rename a document
remarkable_rename("Untitled", "Q4 Planning Notes")

# Delete (destructive; confirms via elicitation when supported)
remarkable_delete("Old Draft")

# Permanently delete in SSH mode only
remarkable_delete("Disposable Test", permanent=True)

# Bulk import (SSH): defer the restart on each write, then refresh once.
# One xochitl restart for the whole batch instead of one per upload.
remarkable_upload("a.pdf", parent_folder="/Research", defer_restart=True)
remarkable_upload("b.pdf", parent_folder="/Research", defer_restart=True)
remarkable_refresh()

# Author native ink and notebooks (SSH only)
# Append pen/highlighter strokes to a page (coordinates normalized [0,1] from
# the page's top-left). The interactive canvas Save button calls this too.
remarkable_author(
    method="draw", document="Ideas", page=1,
    strokes=[{"points": [[0.1, 0.2], [0.8, 0.2]], "tool": "highlighter", "color": "yellow"}],
)

# Append a blank, drawable page to the end of a notebook
remarkable_author(method="add_page", document="Ideas")

# Create a new blank notebook
remarkable_author(method="create_document", name="Sketches")

# Only seed typed text when the user explicitly requested it.
remarkable_author(method="create_document", name="Meeting notes", text="Agenda\nFollow-ups")
```

## Interactive Canvas App (MCP Apps)

An interactive page viewer built on the [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) extension (SEP-1865). Clients that support MCP Apps (such as ChatGPT, Claude, VS Code, and the MCP Inspector) render a canvas in a side panel where you can view a document page and navigate through it.

There is **no flag to enable it** — the `remarkable_canvas` tool and its `ui://remarkable/canvas` resource are always registered, and the capability is negotiated automatically in client capabilities (modern discovery or a legacy initialize handshake). App-capable clients open the interactive canvas; every other client simply receives the rendered page as an image, so the tool is safe and useful everywhere.

This registers one tool:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remarkable_canvas(document, page)` | Open a page in the interactive canvas viewer |

How it behaves:

- **App-capable clients** open the canvas (declared at `ui://remarkable/canvas`, MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app`) and can page through the document via the MCP Apps postMessage bridge — the server delivers each rendered page in the wire result's `structuredContent` (`structured_content` in Python).
- **Other clients** still get the rendered page back as an embedded PNG image, so the tool is useful everywhere; it just won't open the interactive panel. The `_meta.ui` / `ui://` metadata is inert to clients that don't advertise the MCP Apps UI extension.

### Drawing and authoring from the canvas

When write mode is on (the default) **and** the active transport is SSH, the canvas becomes a write surface:

- **Draw**: choose a pen or highlighter, draw, then save native `.rm` ink to the device.
- **Add page**: queue a blank native notebook page, draw on it, then save.
- One source of truth: the canvas calls the **same** `remarkable_author` tool a model would call (`method="draw"` on Save, `method="add_page"` for ＋Page), so the human path and the model path produce byte-identical results.

The Save / Draw / ＋Page controls are hidden when the page isn't writable (read-only mode, or a non-SSH transport), and the canvas falls back to a plain image viewer. The iframe bridge follows the MCP Apps spec but is best validated against your specific client.

## Advanced Configuration

### Root Path Filtering

Limit the MCP server to a specific folder on your reMarkable. All operations will be scoped to this folder:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--ssh"],
      "env": {
        "REMARKABLE_ROOT_PATH": "/Work",
        "GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration:
- `remarkable_browse("/")` shows contents of `/Work`
- `remarkable_browse("/Projects")` shows `/Work/Projects`
- Documents outside `/Work` are not accessible

Useful for:
- Focusing on work documents during office hours
- Separating personal and professional notes
- Limiting scope for specific AI workflows

### Custom Background Color

Set the default background color for image rendering:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "remarkable": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["remarkable-mcp", "--ssh"],
      "env": {
        "REMARKABLE_BACKGROUND_COLOR": "#FFFFFF"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported formats:
- `#RRGGBB`: RGB hex, such as `#FFFFFF`
- `#RRGGBBAA`: RGBA hex, such as `#00000000`

Default is `#FBFBFB` (reMarkable paper color). This affects both the `remarkable_image` tool and image resources.

---

### Retry Configuration

Cloud API requests automatically retry on transient failures (HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) and network errors with exponential backoff and jitter. You can tune this via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REMARKABLE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Maximum number of request attempts (minimum 1) |
| `REMARKABLE_RETRY_DELAY` | `2.0` | Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff |

Rate-limit retries honor numeric and HTTP-date `Retry-After` values, capped at
20 seconds. Authentication failures trigger token renewal instead of retry.

---

### Cloud Performance & Caching

Cloud mode is built to make a device-free workflow fast:

- **Parallel traversal**: fetch document metadata concurrently.
- **Connection pooling**: reuse HTTP connections.
- **Content-addressed blob cache**: reuse immutable blobs by hash and fetch new hashes when documents change.

You normally don't need to configure any of this, but these environment variables let you tune it:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REMARKABLE_SYNC_WORKERS` | `16` | Parallel workers for cloud fetches (clamped to `64`). |
| `REMARKABLE_DISABLE_CACHE` | unset | Set to `1` to disable the on-disk blob cache entirely. |
| `REMARKABLE_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.remarkable/cache/blobs` | Where cached blobs are stored. |
| `REMARKABLE_CACHE_MAX_BLOB` | `4194304` (4 MiB) | Blobs larger than this are streamed through but not cached. |

The cache is purely a local accelerator: deleting `REMARKABLE_CACHE_DIR` only forces the next read to re-download. The mutable cloud root hash is always fetched fresh, so you never see a stale library.

### Multi-transport smoke test

When something looks broken, run the deterministic, no-AI smoke test first. It
drives the real server over MCP and exercises every available tool in every
reachable transport in this order: local directory, cloud, USB web, then SSH.

```bash
uv run python smoke/run_smoke.py            # all available modes
uv run python smoke/run_smoke.py --read-only # connectivity + reads only
```
